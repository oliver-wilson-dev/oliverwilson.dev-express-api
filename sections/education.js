    'I studied at the University of Kent for three years (2014 -2017) and obtained a first class degree with honours in Computer Science upon my graduation.',
    'During my studies I worked on a number of exciting front end projects and really enjoyed the creativity that developing software for the web afforded me.',
    `It is fairly common for Computer Science students to participate in a sandwich-year/year in industry between their second and third years of studying. 
    I chose to progress straight through to my third year and complete my degree within three years. I made this decision because I was thoroughly enjoying the course materials and had a strong self belief that I would find equally valuable experience upon graduating.`,
    'During my final year at University I worked as a consultant for an IT consultancy. I worked with a number of clients to create bespoke web-based solutions to suit their needs.',
