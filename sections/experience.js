        'I have contributed towards the ITV component library which is used on a number of the pages found on the ITV.com domain. Working on a component library was new to me when joining ITV as I had worked on stand alone applications that did not justify a component library in the past. I found the experience of working on a component library to be extremely enlightening while also adding further understanding of alternate approaches towards writing reusable code.',
        "One of the main projects that I worked on was the replatforming of the ITV hub homepage on to a new tech stack utilising react and next JS. The application is isomorphic (hence the use of next JS) and is served through akamai. I've worked on isomorphic applications in the past but this was my first time using next JS; while I appreciate the out-of-the-box simplicity that it offers, I can't help but feel that it abstracts the techniques that it is using from the developer and can prove to be difficult for some team members to make less trivial changes when some additional functionality is required.",
